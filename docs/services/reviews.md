title: Architecture review for Axon projects 
introduction: |
    Axon is a powerful Java development framework supporting project implementations based on 
    Domain- and Event-driven design putting a lot of emphasis on Event sourcing. Domain driven 
    design enforce modularity that intern enables the microservices architecture and provides a 
    very good structured way to define boundaries in the domain with clear indication of the 
    isolated components. Axon helps to build these isolated components, takes care of location 
    transparency, and has native event sourcing even for the most challenging large projects.
