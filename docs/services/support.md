title: Development support for Axon projects
introduction: |
    Axon is a powerful Java development framework supporting project implementations based on Domain- 
    and Event-driven design putting a lot of emphasis on Event sourcing. Domain driven design enforce 
    modularity that intern enables the microservices architecture and provides a very good structured 
    way to define boundaries in the domain with clear indication of the isolated components. Axon helps 
    to build these isolated components, takes care of location transparency, and has native event sourcing 
    even for the most challenging large projects.

## Architecture Review session

Many businesses that require help to develop custom applications are looking for relationships in which their staff can benefit from the ex-posure to high-performance development teams. This not only helps accelerate the development of custom projects, but also teaches skills which aid in the improvement of future projects. For custom software projects, we provide development support by skilled Java developers trained in the cutting edge of open source technologies, including Axon Framework, Spring, TensorFlow, Elasticsearch, Doc2Vec, NoSQL databases and many others.

### Onsite development support
Our developer(s) will become part of your team and will help to accelerate the development of your project.

### Remote email support (48 hours response time)
Supporting the developers to answer questions, raise issues or file the feature request. 
We aim 48 hours response time to the support questions. 

### Support conference calls
1-hour conference calls (or online meetings) to support the developers either in initial phase of setting up the 
Axon project, or in the critical project phase of the project but also to discuss the issues related to 
integration with other parts of the projects. Basically these are the ‘Ask me anything’ calls on a regular basis.
