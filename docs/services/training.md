title: Axon Framework training program (1-4 days) 
introduction: |
    Axon is a powerful Java development framework which supports the implementation of projects based on
    Domain Driven Design (DDD) with a lot of emphasis on Events. Axon Framework follows the Command Query
    Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture pattern and helps to separate business logic from infrastructure logic.
    It allows applications to start with a simple setup and scale out later by configuring the infrastructure components.
    Axon Frame-work offers ready-to-use non-functional features which easily save up to several man-months of
    development time and minimize the cost to build, operate, or change an application, without compromising its
    business value.

## Objectives
- Understanding the fundamentals of Event sourcing and Domain Driven Design
- Learning how to set up projects with Axon for developing complex,
future-proof applications 
- Experience how Axon Framework helps to securely put the domain model into production
- Get started quickly!

## Training setup

### Fundamentals of DDD and CQRS with exercises
*1 Day*

This course provides essential background knowledge required for
designing Domain Models suitable for use in a CQRS-based architecture.
- Understanding the big picture - the concepts and modeling with DDD
- Learning the CQRS concepts and rationale
- Task based UI and eventual consistency
- Event sourcing in distributed systems

### Introduction to Axon Framework
*1 Day*

Get started with Axon, the Java development framework which enables rapid
CQRS-based application development.
- Getting started by setting up the infrastructure components
and organizing the codebase practically
- Aggregates: learn how to design, implement, and test Aggregates
- Event handling: implementing and configuring the event handlers;
async vs sync, transaction management
- Query model: the design process for projections, denormalization tactics,
and different ways to update a query model
- Event sourcing: how to apply event sourcing, snapshotting,
and reconstructing a projection from historic events
- Sagas: coordinating activity between components - implementation,
configuration, testing, and common pitfalls
- Task based UI and dealing with eventual consistency

## Advanced features of Axon Framework
*2 Days*

In this 2-day workshop participants will learn how to use Axon’s advanced
features, how to use Axon in a distributed environment, and how to deal
with the evolution of an application.
- Refactoring and evolving your application: evolving Commands
and Events, Upcasting, changes in Aggregate boundaries
- Building Microservices with Axon: distributed systems, distributed
command and event handling, designing events for dis-tribution
- Complex Sagas
- Replay Event Store: consolidation
- Advanced conguration and tuning: unit of work, message interceptors,
parameter resolvers, serialization, system vs ap-plication events,
handler enhancers
- Integration and deployment in production
- Monitoring, measuring throughout &latency, message tracing.
and learn from each other's point of view.

## Delivery 
- Instructor-led classes given by skilled staff
- Best practices and know-how embedded in hands-on labs
- Interactive learning environment with strong Q&A
- Available in English
- On-site or at your premises

## Benefits
- Get the development team facing in the same direction 
- Help to align the domain design language and principles and develop a strong connection
between the architects, developers, product owners, and business problem owners 
- Avoid common pitfalls in project setup
- Expert’s answers to specific/advanced questions

## Audience
The Axon training courses and workshop are designed for Software Architects, Software Developers, 
Technical Team Leads, Enterprise Architects, Product Owners, and Business Owners.
 
## Prerequisites 
- For the developers, a good understanding of the Java language is required
- Enterprise application development experience is recommended
- Developers are expected to bring their own laptop with the IDE of their choice 
- For non-developers, some affinity with Java is useful, although practical coding experience is not required.
