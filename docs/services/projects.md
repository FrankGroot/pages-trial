title: Trifork
introduction: |
    Trifork’s vision is to become known as the company that inspires and advises on the optimization of 
    business-critical IT systems and future technology innovations. 
    Custom software creates competitive differentiation, but can be hard to accomplish and is often accompanied 
    by errors and expenses. Many businesses that require help to develop custom applications are looking for 
    relationships in which their staff can benefit from the exposure to high-performance development teams. 
    This not only helps accelerate the development of custom projects, but also teaches skills which aid in 
    the improvement of future projects.
