In this webinar, we will take a DDD/CQRS approach on implementing Microservices, focusing on the messaging between them. We will discuss different approaches to ensure decoupling of services on the API level, but also ensuring flexibility to change the system's behavior at runtime simply by switching services on and off.
#### Presented by Allard Buijze, founder of Axon Framework
