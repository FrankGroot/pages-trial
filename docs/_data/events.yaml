  title: Messaging Patterns in Event-Driven Microservices Architectures
  summary: Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) are known to provide us with means to tackle complexity within an application. However, they also provide us with patterns and guidelines to manage the complexity of large scale, distributed environments. Join the meetup and share your thoughts and experiences on this topic.
